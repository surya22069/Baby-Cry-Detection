# Baby-Cry-Detection
Built a CNN-RNN model using advanced audio features to classify baby cries and deployed it with a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
i have made 3 model which use different features so for the whole project i have used infant cry audio corpus dataset which is publicly available in kaggle
and in my mel model it self i have made code so that pre-processed audio is extracted and saved for further model development and finally the deployment of the models done through streamlit
